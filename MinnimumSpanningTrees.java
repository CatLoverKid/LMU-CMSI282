//	INPUT: Undirected, Weighted, Graph
//	OUTPUT: A FREE Tree that is a subgraph of the original, which uses all the nodes and whose composite weight is minimal

//      GREEDY OPTION: Prim's Algorithm:
//		Start at a random point, add the closest point, continue to pick now with the new node's neighbors included in the list of options

// 	GREEDY OPTION: Kruskal's Algorithm
//		At Each Iteration, coalesce two disjoint structures via cheapest edge
//			This method requires the edges to be pre-sorted by weight (cost)
